# Running-tracker-analysis

The Running Tracker Analysis project is a Python-based application designed to track and analyze running activities. It allows users to log runs, calculate key statistics, and perform data analysis, such as finding the fastest pace, longest run, and total distance run. The project supports CSV data storage and retrieval for easy tracking of multiple runs over time.

This project leverages the power of Python to track and visualize running data efficiently. It uses the following libraries:

Matplotlib: For plotting detailed and interactive graphs to visualize running metrics.
NumPy: To perform efficient calculations, analyze metrics, and process data for plotting.
These libraries enable the application to generate insightful visualizations and provide a deeper understanding of running performance.
